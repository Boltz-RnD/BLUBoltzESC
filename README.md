# BLUBoltzESC

A Remixed Board Design from The BlueESC with a large footprint and Utilizing easy to source components for a DIYer.

I've made this ESC Board Design for a College Project,but you can use it wherever however you want.

Although it may look a DIY Design but is no diffrent than a 60A version of BlueESC, It runs on a Forked Version of Simonk's TGY firmware.

Unlike other DIY ESC, This one is a lot more reliable and is much more Optimized (Thanks to the TGY Firmware). 

The Firmware for this ESC is same as that of BlueESC and can be found at https://github.com/bluerobotics/tgy

Feel Free to Contribute and develop A better smaller but still DIY-able ESC.
